This project allows users to track their spending on various categories. By keeping a running total of these expenditures, one will constantly be able to view the money currently being used from one's budget as well as the how the spendings are distributed. Please note that this project is still being updated. Graphs will be added in order to properly portray one's budget and the proportions being spent in each category.

This application was created for the purposes of practicing web development by Eric Cha, a current computer science major studying at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. The project used the Spring MVC framework, and is a largely Java and Javascript based. Spring Security was used to differentiate between users and admins. User data as well as data for budgets was stored with queries to MySQL by using JDBC. Configuration with Microsoft Outlook was also necessary in order to implement the email sending in the "Forgotton Password?" page.
